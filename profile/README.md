# Hey. Welcome to Aency
Aency is an independent technology organization focused on building
open-source tools, developer utilities, and experimental systems.

We operate as a lab, not an agency.
**Code comes first. Hype does not.**

---

## What we do
- Open-source software and tooling
- CLIs, TUIs, and terminal-focused projects
- Systems experimentation and infrastructure utilities
- Developer-first products with long-term intent

Aency functions as an organization that hosts multiple independent projects.
Each repository is treated as a product, with clear goals and ownership.

Some projects are experimental.
Some are stable.
**All are real.**
